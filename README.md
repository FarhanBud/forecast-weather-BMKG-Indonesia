# 🌦️ BMKG Weather Forecast Dashboard

Descriptive Analytics & Interactive Data Visualization using BMKG Public API

---

##  Project Overview
This project aims to transform raw weather forecast data from the **BMKG Public API (Indonesia’s official meteorological agency)** into an interactive and easy-to-understand dashboard.  
The dashboard provides insights into weather conditions across major Indonesian cities, helping users identify patterns, trends, and differences in temperature, humidity, wind, and overall weather conditions.

The project focuses on **descriptive analytics**, emphasizing clarity, usability, and real-world relevance rather than predictive modeling.

---

##  Objectives
- Visualize weather forecast data in a clear and interactive dashboard.
- Analyze temperature, humidity, wind, and cloud coverage trends.
- Compare weather conditions across multiple cities.
- Convert raw meteorological data into actionable insights.

---

##  Scope of Analysis
The analysis covers five major cities in Indonesia:
- Jakarta  
- Tangerang  
- Depok  
- Bogor  
- Bandung  

Weather data is analyzed on an **hourly basis**, allowing users to observe daily patterns and short-term weather changes.

---

##  Key Insights
From the dashboard analysis, several key patterns were identified:

- Urban cities such as **Jakarta and Tangerang show higher average temperatures** compared to Bandung.
- **Average humidity levels reach around 85%**, indicating high moisture in the atmosphere.
- **Cloud coverage is consistently high (around 99%)**, suggesting dominant overcast conditions.
- The most common weather conditions are **Cloudy and Light Rain**, reflecting Indonesia’s tropical climate.
- **Wind speed remains relatively low and stable**, indicating calm atmospheric movement.
- Each city exhibits distinct **microclimate characteristics** influenced by geography and urban density.

---

##  Business Value & Use Cases
This dashboard can support decision-making in various real-world scenarios:

- **Government & Public Services** – Daily planning and weather awareness.
- **Event Management** – Scheduling outdoor activities based on weather conditions.
- **Logistics & Transportation** – Risk mitigation related to weather changes.
- **Smart City Initiatives** – Integrating environmental data into urban planning.
- **General Public** – Quick access to reliable weather insights.
